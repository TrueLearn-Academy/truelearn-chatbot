### Updating Academy Information

Edit the `ACADEMY_INFO` dictionary in `app.py` to customize:

- Contact information
- Features and benefits
- Academy description

### Styling

The chatbot interface can be customized by modifying the CSS in `templates/index.html`. The design uses:

- Modern gradient backgrounds
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design principles
- Professional color scheme

### System Prompt

The AI's behavior can be customized by modifying the `create_system_prompt()` function in `app.py`. This controls:

- How the AI responds to questions
- What information it provides
- The tone and style of responses

## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
python app.py
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider using:

- **WSGI Server**: Gunicorn or uWSGI
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx
- **Process Manager**: PM2 or Supervisor
- **Environment**: Set `FLASK_ENV=production`

Example with Gunicorn:
```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

## Security Considerations

- Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Consider adding user authentication for sensitive operations
